# 🧬 A Garden of Code, Seeds of Discovery

**Welcome to this humble repository**, where the mysteries of life unfold through lines of code. From the symphony of bulk RNA-seq to the whispered secrets of single cells, from the spatial choreography of tissues to the computational poetry of genomics—all knowledge here stands unguarded, waiting to be discovered.

<div align="center">

*In the vast digital cosmos where data flows like rivers,*  
*Here blooms a sanctuary of open science—*  
*Where every algorithm is a gift freely given,*  
*Every script a bridge across the unknown.*

*Like ancient scholars who shared their scrolls,*  
*We believe that science belongs to all humanity.*  
*Each function, each pipeline, each visualization*  
*Is offered with open hands and an open heart.*

*"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."* - Gandhi

*May these codes serve as stepping stones*  
*For minds yet to explore,*  
*For discoveries yet to be born,*  
*For the endless dance of science and wonder.*

**✨ All code shared freely • No strings attached • Science for all humanity ✨**
